# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:

# user = User.create(name: 'Michael', email: 'webdev10100@gmail.com', password: 'password', admin: 'true' )
